          I spent years in a biophysics lab at the University of Fribourg, building optical trapping systems and processing gigabytes of spectral data in Python. Somewhere along the way I realized I cared more about the code than the experiments.

          Now I work at the intersection of AI tooling and implementation. My daily toolkit is Claude Code — not for toy demos, but for shipping real systems. I know the CLAUDE.md architecture, MCP ecosystem, agent patterns, and context engineering deeply because I use them to build things every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consult with companies who want to implement AI properly. Workshops on their actual codebase. Agent architectures for their actual problems. The goal is always the same: working systems, not slide decks.
