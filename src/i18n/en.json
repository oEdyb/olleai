  "about.label": "About",
  "about.headline": "Physicist \u2192 AI engineer",
  "about.p1": "I ended up in biophysics kind of by accident. A professor mentioned a project in Switzerland, I said yes, and before I knew it I was at the University of Fribourg working with the most advanced optical trapping setup in the world. Trapping proteins, writing analysis code, the whole thing.",
  "about.p2": "Turns out the code was the part I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about.",
  "about.p3": "I found AI and it clicked immediately. Building with it, testing every new tool, figuring out what actually works. Claude Code, agents, context engineering. That\u2019s what I do now.",
  "about.p4": "I teach what I learn. A million people have watched me do it on TikTok. I consult for companies that want to ship with AI, not just talk about it.",

  "consulting.workshop.price": "\u20ac3,000",

  "consulting.advisory.price": "\u20ac1,500/mo",
